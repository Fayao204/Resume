        <li>Objective
            <ul>
                <li>I am a language enthusiast with three years of work experience as a French and Spanish tutor. Being able to navigate different cultures while serving as a bridge between folks who cannot understand each other is my biggest inspiration for choosing to become a web developper. At the end of my course on udemy, I intend to create interactive websites to taste of my clients, provide contant updates to help keep up with the ever evolving nature of the programming space, and to contribute immensely towards the growth and development of the web development community.</li>
